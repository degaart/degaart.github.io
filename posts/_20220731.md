# Learn git in 5 minutes

Five minutes. That's all you need to learn git. But first, a message from our sponsor:

## What is git and why would you need to use it

Git is a distributed version control system.
A version control system stores changes in a codebase, along with metadata: date, author, and the difference
from the previous version. That means multiple people can work on a single projet without having to send code
to each other. Even in the case of single-person projects, the history of the code is preserved, letting you
go back to previous versions.
Git is a distributed version control system. That means it is possible to work offline, and each working copy
is a clone of the master repository. Ok I confused you there. Fret no, that just means everyone that is working
on the project has a copy of the version history of the project, so even in the case the main repository gets
deleted, data is still recoverable.

## What is a repository

## Create a repository

## Make your changes

## Upload your changes to the server

## Make other changes

## Revert local changes

## Dealing with conflicts
