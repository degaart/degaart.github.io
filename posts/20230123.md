# print! and println! in rust no_std

In the [previous post](20230122.html), we created a rust executable which
didn't use std. It could write to stdout using a write\_string() function, but
if we tried to use `print!` or `println!` to print formatted strings, it
wouldn't work:

```
error: cannot find macro `println` in this scope
```

We're gonna see next how to use these formatting macros work.

## Initial code

We start with the following source code:

```
// src/main.rs

#![no_std]
#![no_main]

extern "C" {
    fn write(fildes: i32, buf: *const core::ffi::c_void, nbyte: usize);
}

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! { 
    loop {}
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> u32 {
    let msg = b"It works!\n";
    unsafe {
        write(1, msg.as_ptr() as *const core::ffi::c_void, msg.len());
    }   
    0
}
```

## write\_string

Having to define a binary string and an usafe block just to print a string is
ugly, so we're going to create a function that takes a string and prints it to
stdout

```
use core::ffi::c_void;

fn write_string(s: &str) {
    unsafe {
        write(1, s.as_ptr() as *const c_void, s.len());
    }
}
```

Nothing special there, it just takes what we've already done and wraps it
inside a safe function. It also imports `core::ffi::c_void` because it's used
several times in our source code.

## Implementing a fmt::Write

Formatted output in rust uses the `fmt::Write` trait. Let's create a new struct
that implements it

```
use core::fmt;

pub struct Writer;

impl fmt::Write for Writer {
    fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
        write_string(s);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

We can call it with the following:

```
use fmt::Write;
Writer{}.write_str("It works!\n").unwrap();
```

We need to import `fmt::Write` because methods from traits needs to imported
before use.

Implementing `fmt::Write` is not just a convoluted way to output strings, it
also enables the `Write::write_fmt` function which can be used for formatted
output:

```
use fmt::Write;
Writer{}.write_fmt(format_args!("It works\n")).unwrap();
```

`Write::write_fmt` is declared as:

```
fn write_fmt(&mut self, args: Arguments<'_>) -> Result
```

The `format_args!` just takes a list of arguments and create an `Argument`
struct out of them. More complicated formatting is possible thusly:

```
use fmt::Write;
Writer{}.write_fmt(format_args!("{}\n", "It works")).unwrap();
```

## Simplifying formatted output using a print function

We can simplify this code further by creating a function that creates a
temporary writer and writes to it:

```
fn print(args: fmt::Arguments) {
    use fmt::Write;
    Writer{}.write_fmt(args).unwrap();
}
```

Our formatted output call can then be simplified to:

```
print(format_args!("{}!\n", "It works"));
```

## print! and println!

We can forego the usage of `format_args` by defining a macro that calls it for
us:

```
macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print(format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```

This macro forwards its arguments to `format_args`, and calls `print`,
simplifying our earlier call to:

```
print!("{}!\n", "It works");
```

And we can now implement a `println!` macro by using `print`:

```
macro_rules! println {
    () => {{
        print!("\n");
    }};
    
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print!("{}\n", format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```

At the call site:

```
println!("{}!", "It works");
```

## Reusable output printing functions

All our printing functions are defined in the same file for now, let's put them
in a separate file so they can be reused in other modules and source files.

Copy all our formatted output functions in a new `src/print.rs` file, and fix
imports:

```
// src/print.rs
use core::ffi::c_void;
use core::fmt;

extern "C" {
    fn write(fildes: i32, buf: *const c_void, nbyte: usize);
}

pub fn write_string(s: &str) {
    unsafe {
        write(1, s.as_ptr() as *const c_void, s.len());
    }
}

pub struct Writer;

impl fmt::Write for Writer {
    fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
        write_string(s);
        Ok(())
    }
}

pub fn print(args: fmt::Arguments) {
    use fmt::Write;
    Writer{}.write_fmt(args).unwrap();
}

macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print(format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}

macro_rules! println {
    () => {{
        print!("\n");
    }};

    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print!("{}\n", format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```

Back into `src/main.rs`, we can get rid of the imports, and we need to import
the `print` module:

```
// src/main.rs

#![no_std]
#![no_main]

mod print;

#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    loop {}
}   

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> u32 {
    println!("{}!", "It works");
    0
}
```

We're greeted with this lovely compile error:

```
error: cannot find macro `println` in this scope
```

That's because we didn't export our macros. We need to annotate `print!` and
`println!` with `#[macro_export]`. That will make the macros exportable and put
them at the crate root:

```
// src/print.rs
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print(format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! println {
    () => {{
        print!("\n");
    }};

    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print!("{}\n", format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```

We get the following error:

```
error[E0423]: expected function, found module `print`
  --> src/print.rs:31:9
   |
31 |         print(format_args!($($arg)*));
   |         ^^^^^ not a function
```

That's because back at `main.rs`, the println! macro was expanded, and it
contains a call to the `print` functions, which is not defined in main.rs but
in print.rs. We need make the macro expand to the full path to the `print`
function.

```
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::print::print(format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```

`$crate` is expanded to the current crate, so our macro can be called from
other crates.

Our program now compiles and run without error.

However, if we remove the `println!` invocation in main, the compiler
complains:

```
warning: function `print` is never used
```

So we need annotate our print function `#[allow(unused)]`.

```
#[allow(unused)]
pub fn print(args: fmt::Arguments) {
    use fmt::Write;
    Writer{}.write_fmt(args).unwrap();
}
```

## Exiting with an error code

Until now, our panic handler just enters an infinite loop. So if we had the
following in main.rs, we wouldn't be able to know if there's a panic, yet alone
read the error message from the panic call.

```
panic!("Someone set us the bomb!");
```

To solve this, we first need to make our executable exit with an error code.
That's accomplished by calling the libc function `exit`. We declare it thusly:

```
extern "C" {
    fn exit(status: i32) -> !;
}
```

It's a function that never returns, so we can make it return the never type.

Now our panic handler becomes:

```
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(_info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    unsafe {
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

When we run our program, it exits with a status code of 1.

## Implementing panic messages

The `core::panic::PanicInfo` conveniently implements `core::fmt::Display`, so
it can be formatted:


```
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    println!("{}", info);
    unsafe {
        exit(1);
    }
}
```

Which gives us a nice panic message when ran:

```
panicked at 'Somebody set us the bomb', src/main.rs:21:5
```

## Putting it all together

### src/main.rs

```
// src/main.rs
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

mod print; 

extern "C" {
    fn exit(status: i32) -> !;
}
    
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &core::panic::PanicInfo) -> ! {
    println!("{}", info);
    unsafe {
        exit(1);
    }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> u32 {
    panic!("Somebody set us the bomb");
    0
}
```

### src/print.rs

```
// src/print.rs
use core::ffi::c_void;
use core::fmt;

extern "C" {
    fn write(fildes: i32, buf: *const c_void, nbyte: usize);
}

pub fn write_string(s: &str) {
    unsafe {
        write(1, s.as_ptr() as *const c_void, s.len());
    }
}

pub struct Writer;

impl fmt::Write for Writer {
    fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
        write_string(s);
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[allow(unused)]
pub fn print(args: fmt::Arguments) {
    use fmt::Write;
    Writer{}.write_fmt(args).unwrap();
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! print {
    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        $crate::print::print(format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! println {
    () => {{
        print!("\n");
    }};

    ($($arg:tt)*) => {{
        print!("{}\n", format_args!($($arg)*));
    }}
}
```
